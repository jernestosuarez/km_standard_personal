# Knowledge Management Standard

**Current version: v1.19** (2026-08-06). The full ledger of released versions, and the rule that a
published version number is never reused, is in [`STANDARD.md`](STANDARD.md) → *Version history*.
Pin the version you adopted; adopting a later one is a decision, not a background update.

A reproducible, organization-agnostic framework for standing up a governed, agent-readable knowledge
hub for any initiative — a project, a team, a product line, a nonprofit, a research group. It is not
tied to any specific company, industry, or AI vendor.

## What's in this package

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`STANDARD.md`](STANDARD.md) | The full standard — architecture, governance rules, frontmatter spec, ontology layer, checklists. Read this first. |
| [`template/`](template/) | A ready-to-copy reference hub: stub docs, `context.jsonld`, `km-deployment.md`, entity-note folders (`decisions/`, `risks/`, `stakeholders/`, `milestones/`, `partners/`), governance files, and the per-hub agent skills (`km-intake`, `km-propose`, `km-gather`, `km-start`, `km-handover`, `km-brief`) already wired up for Claude Code and AGENTS.md-compatible tools. |
| [`contracts/organization-profile.schema.json`](contracts/organization-profile.schema.json) | Portable JSON contract for an approved Enterprise Knowledge Layer organization profile. |
| [`scripts/validate_organization_profile.py`](scripts/validate_organization_profile.py) | Dependency-free validator for profile shape, compatibility, safe paths, and module eligibility. |
| [`skills/km-init/`](skills/km-init/SKILL.md) | Workspace-level skill: stands up a brand-new hub from `template/`. |
| [`skills/km-supervise/`](skills/km-supervise/SKILL.md) | Optional workspace-level skill: routes a source that touches multiple hubs (the "Supervisor tier"). Includes a starter `_KM_Supervisor_template/`. |
| [`skills/km-brief/`](skills/km-brief/SKILL.md) | Per-hub skill: generates an audience-tailored memo/briefing/status report by querying entity notes instead of freehand-reading hub docs. |
| [`agents/km-hub-builder/`](agents/km-hub-builder/SKILL.md) | Optional Standard Maintainer package: one governed contract, distributable Claude and Codex adapters, safe installation, and runtime-parity checks. It changes standards and hands adoption to the Supervisor; it never edits hubs. |
| [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/README.md) | Architecture documentation: the layer model, the canonical-first hub deployment protocol, the OrganizationProfile contract, and authority boundaries. Descriptive, not normative. |

## Quick start — one hub

1. Read [`STANDARD.md`](STANDARD.md), sections "Purpose" through "Governance Layer."
2. Copy [`template/`](template/) to your new hub's location, e.g. `cp -R template/ ~/projects/my-initiative`.
3. Replace every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in the copied files (see the placeholder map in
   [`skills/km-init/SKILL.md`](skills/km-init/SKILL.md)) — or, if you're using an AI agent that
   supports custom skills, install `skills/km-init/SKILL.md` and invoke it to do this
   interactively.
4. `git init`, make the initial commit, and run `hub-scan.sh` (Steps 1 and 4–5 in `STANDARD.md`).
   That scaffold commit is the one place a blanket `git add -A` is safe; after it, stage the paths you
   touched (see *Rule 3 → Stage explicitly*), which matters most when the hub lives in synced storage.
5. Start working: drop files in `_inbox/`, propose changes in `changes/`, run `hub-scan.sh` at the
   start of every session. Track individual decisions/risks/stakeholders/milestones/partners as entity
   notes (`decisions/`, `risks/`, `stakeholders/`, `milestones/`, `partners/`), not as table rows in
   the numbered docs — see "Ontology & Entity Layer" in `STANDARD.md`. Use `/km-brief` to generate a
   memo or briefing from those entity notes for a given audience.

`km-init` always creates a canonical-only hub and records its canonical version, revision, and source
in `km-deployment.md`. Organization binding is a separate Supervisor action. The Supervisor resolves
and validates an approved OrganizationProfile from the configured Enterprise Knowledge Layer, then
records the organization customization in a second commit.

No AI agent is required to use this standard — it works as a plain governance discipline for a
human-maintained markdown folder. The optional skills exist to automate the mechanical parts (digesting
sources, drafting proposals, running the scan) for teams using an AI coding/knowledge assistant.

## Quick start — multiple hubs that share sources

Only needed once you run two or more hubs and a single source (e.g. a weekly all-hands) produces facts
relevant to more than one of them. See "Supervisor Tier — Cross-Hub Orchestration" in `STANDARD.md`,
and [`skills/km-supervise/`](skills/km-supervise/SKILL.md) for the operating skill.

## License / reuse

This standard is free to adopt, adapt, fork, and redistribute for any organization's internal or
external knowledge management needs. No attribution required.
